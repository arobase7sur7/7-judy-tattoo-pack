# **7 Judy Tattoo Pack – FiveM Addon Resource**

A high-quality addon tattoo pack inspired by **Judy Alvarez from Cyberpunk 2077**, fully adapted and positioned manually for **FiveM**.
Includes HD textures (2K and 4K for some tattoos) and ready-to-use Illenium Tattoos configuration.

## 📦 **What’s Included**

* **FiveM-ready resource folder:**
  `7-judy-tattoo-pack`
* **Illenium Tattoos configuration file:**
  `illenium config.lua`
  → Preconfigured addon tattoos you can simply copy into your Illenium config in the correct sections.

## ✨ **Features**

* Fully **addon**, **no replacements** of vanilla tattoos.
* HD textures:

  * Most tattoos in **High Definition**
  * Some in **2K**
  * Some in **4K**
* Every tattoo **placed manually**, item by item, for accurate positioning on FiveM ped models.
* Some tattoos include **left/right variations** (not all).
* Tattoos are **individual pieces**, not a single full-body tattoo:
  → You can **mix and combine** them freely.
* Compatible with any framework (**ESX, QB, Standalone**).
* Plug-and-play FiveM resource.

## 📁 **Installation**

### **1. Add the resource to your server**

Place the folder:

```
7-judy-tattoo-pack
```

into your `resources` directory.

Then add this to your `server.cfg`:

```
ensure 7-judy-tattoo-pack
```

### **2. Illenium Tattoos (optional, recommended)**

Inside the pack is:

```
illenium config.lua
```

* Open the file.
* Copy the tattoo entries.
* Paste them into **each relative section** of your `illenium_tattoos/config.lua`.

Done — the pack will appear as addon tattoos in Illenium.
